## Resend

[Resend](https://resend.com) is the email API for developers.

### Installation

Follow [Resend Documentation](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-nextjs) on how to setup resend in your project.

<Callout type="warn">
  Remember to add the RESEND_API_KEY to the environment variables.
</Callout>

### Utility

Create the file mail.ts in the lib folder, this file will have a `sendEmail` utility function.

<TypeTable
  type={{
    email: {
      description: "Who the email is designated for.",
      type: "string",
    },
    subject: {
      description: "The subject of the email.",
      type: "string",
    },
    body: {
      description: "The Content of the email.",
      type: "React.ReactElement",
    },
  }}
/>

```typescript title="mail.ts"
import { env } from "@/env";

import { Resend } from "resend";

const resend = new Resend(env.RESEND_API_KEY);

export const sendEmail = async (
  email: string,
  subject: string,
  body: React.ReactElement,
) => {
  await resend.emails.send({
    from: "onboarding@resend.dev",
    to: email,
    subject: subject,
    react: body,
  });
};
```

<Callout>
  Unless you have a domain keep onboarding@resend.dev, otherwise use
  domain@mail.com
</Callout>

## React Email

[React Email](https://react.email) is for building and sending emails using React and TypeScript.

### Installation

<Tabs items={["npm", "pnpm"]}>
    <Tab value='npm'>

```bash
npm install @react-email/components -E
```

    </Tab>
    <Tab value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add @react-email/components -E
```

    </Tab>

</Tabs>

<Callout>
  Visit [React email](https://react.email/docs/introduction) docs for more
  information
</Callout>

### Components

Create a folder `emails` in your components folder:

<Files>
  <Folder name="components" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="emails" defaultOpen />
  </Folder>
</Files>

<Callout>This folder is for all your email components.</Callout>

## Usage

Create an email component in the emails folder:

```tsx title="demo.tsx"
import { Body, Html, Text } from "@react-email/components";

export function DemoEmail() {
  return (
    <Html lang="en">
      <Body>
        <Text>This is my Demo email!!!</Text>
      </Body>
    </Html>
  );
}
```

Finally create an action which sends the email:

```typescript
import { sendEmail } from "@/lib/mail";

import { DemoEmail } from "@/components/emails/demo";

export async function action() {
  const email = "johndoe@gmail.com";
  const subject = "Hello !!!";

  await sendEmail(email, subject, DemoEmail());
}
```
